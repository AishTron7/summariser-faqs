        <h1>FAQs (for AI Review Summary Extension)</h1>

        <div class="faq">
            Q1. While installing the extension, I’m getting a message: “This extension is not trusted by Enhanced Safe
            Browsing.”
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Ans: For new chrome developers, it generally takes a few months to become trusted. Please click on ‘continue
            to install’.
        </div><br>

        <div class="faq">
            Q2. I get the summary of all reviews for products having 6-7 pages of reviews, but for products that have
            greater than ten pages of reviews, I only get the summary of first ten pages of reviews.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Ans: The current word capacity of the AI model used (GPT-3.5-turbo) is around 3000 words (4k tokens). We
            have found that 10 pages of reviews is the sweet spot for most products i.e. summarising more than 10 pages
            might exceed the 3000 word limit of OpenAI’s model. Moreover, we feel that a summary of ten pages gives a
            good enough idea of the product’s performance to the customer. We may increase this limit of ten pages as we
            get access to GPT 4 API which has a larger capacity.
        </div><br>

        <div class="faq">
            Q3. I’m getting a message “reviews for this product might be too long for GPT's current capacity”
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Ans: For some products, customers tend to give lengthy reviews, in such cases, ten pages of reviews can
            exceed the 3000 word limit set by OpenAI. Please use the extension for a different product for now, while we
            strive to mitigate this issue.
        </div><br>

        <div class="faq">
            Q4. I’m getting a message: “A summary is not required due to lack of reviews” even when reviews are there
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Ans: Make sure you are on the correct page. You do not need to click on ‘see all reviews’. Just open the
            product page on flipkart, open the extension, and click the ‘generate summary’ button.
